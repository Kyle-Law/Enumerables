# Enumerables

> Ruby Enumerable methods are rebuilt to solidify my understanding of Ruby Array, methods, Procs, Blocks, yield, etc. This project is created from scratch and solely by [@Kyle-Law](https://github.com/Kyle-Law). The project is built according to [this project on the odin project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/advanced-building-blocks), assignment 2.

This project is also the second project of Microverse Software Development Program - Ruby Section. Branches that merged into the master branch are verified and approved by Microverse's Technical Support Engineers.

This project is achieved under the following restrictions:
- Module must below 100 lines(except comments).
- Each methods must below 20 lines.
- `yield` must be used
- `my_each`, `my_each_with_index`, `my_select`, `my_map` return the Enumerator when no argument/block is given
- `my_all?`, `my_any?`, `my_none?` can check for Class/Regex/Other parameter
